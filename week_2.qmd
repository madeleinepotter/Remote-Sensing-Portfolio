title: "Week 4: Policy"

This week I have chosen to look at Jakarta, currently the capital city of Indonesia and home to over 10 million people (including my family) in the immediate area and over 30 million people in the wider metropolitan area \'Jabodetabek\'. Sitting on swampy lands with 13 major rivers running through it, Jakarta has always been naturally vulnerable to floods which have gradually worsened since it\'s occupation by the Dutch East India Company in the 17^th^ century. This is mainly due to land subsidence caused by extensive ground water extraction meaning that Jakarta has almost quite literally dug itself into a hole. Currently, Jakarta is sinking at a rate of around 24cm a year. Being located on the coast, it now also faces the issue of sea level rise caused by climate change.

One of the worst floods occurred in 2007 where around 70% of the city was submerged with water after a period of heavy rain. Over 400,000 people were affected, 57 people died and economic losses totalled around USD 900 million \[\@RetrospectiveViewFloods\]. Since then, significant flooding has also occurred in 2013, 2014, 2020, 2021 and 2022. It has become so bad it was one of the reasons the government decided it would be moving the capital city to a new site in Kalimantan.

Policy is being constantly revised to try and solve the issue with one of the most significant plans in recent years being the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development Plan (NCICDP). This includes strengthening its existing coastal defence infrastructure and the construction of a large new sea wall, lagoons and 17 artificial islands to tackle tidal flooding.
