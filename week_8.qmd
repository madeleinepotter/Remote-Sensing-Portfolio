## Summary

### Object-Based Image Analysis

This involves pixels being grouped into objects based on similarity or difference of the cells. This group of pixels is also known as a **superpixel**, which can provide a condensed representation of images that can be useful for computationally demanding analysis. Â 

Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) Algorithm is the most common method to generate superpixels. The algorithm produces superpixels by clustering pixels based on spatial proximity and colour similarity.

### Sub-Pixel Analysis

When we have a pixel that has a range of land cover classes within it, the challenge becomes whether we should calculate the proportions of each land cover class within the pixel or just classify it as one specific land cover class.

Sub-pixel analysis can help with this by separating pixels into sub-pixels to predict their landcover class labels by comparing the reflectance values of the sub-pixels to the values of a spectrally pure end member. By doing this, classification is conducted at a finer spatial resolution.

### Accuracy Assessment

We produce an accuracy assessment to determine how well the model performed in identifying different classes in unseen data.

In remote sensing, the most common form of accuracy assessment is to consider the producer\'s accuracy, user\'s accuracy, and overall accuracy, which are all derived from a confusion matrix. All measurements and equations to derive them are shown in the matrix below.

**Kappa Coefficient:** evaluates how well the classification model performed compared to just assigning random values. Ranges from -1 to 1. It's use in remote sensing is discouraged, if using probably best to use last and with the support of other accuracy measures.

**F1:** Combines both user accuracy and producer accuracy. Ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating better performance.

**Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (the ROC Curve):**

The curve plots the true positive and false positive rate. The AUC (area under the ROC curve) has a value between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 having more accurate predictions.

**Cross Validation:** this trains the model on different subsets of the data. There are many different methods of cross validation.

### Spatial Cross Validation

When data is spatial, spatial autocorrelation can become a potential issue and impact the model. If we randomly split spatial data it can lead to training points being neighbours with testing points, leading to the test and training datasets not being independent which can lead to overfitting.

To avoid this, we can perform spatial cross validation which involves spatially partitioning the folded data.
