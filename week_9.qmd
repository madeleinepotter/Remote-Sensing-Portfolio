## Summary

This week we had a more in-depth look into Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

### Key Words:

**Backscatter:** the proportion of outgoing radar signal that the target surface redirects back to the sensor.

**Amplitude:** the amount of radar signal that returns to the sensor (backscatter).

**Phase:** the alignment of the wavelength when it returns to the sensor.

**Polarization:** the orientation of the plane in which electromagnetic waves are transmitted.

### SAR

The way SAR works is the sensor emits an electromagnetic (microwaves) signal towards the earth's surface and it collects data by recording the amount of signal that is bounced back and the time delay. SAR is an active sensor and it's main advantage is that it can 'see through' clouds, which optical sensors cannot do. It can do this because the wavelength is longer than cloud particles so the signal travelling through is largely unaffected by refraction.

SAR can collect data at different polarizations and as different surfaces respond differently to each polarization it is a useful way to draw out different land cover features.

-   Rough Scattering is most sensitive to vertical vertical (VV)

-   Volume Scattering is most sensitive to to cross polarized data such as vertical horizontal (VH) or horizontal vertical (HV)

-   Double Bounce is most sensitive to horizontal horizontal (HH)

### Identifying Change

Remotely sensed data can be used to detect changes in the earth's surface over time. We can do this with SAR data.

It is possible to subtract images to identify differences in pixel values, however this is not best practice for SAR data and is usually done with optical data.

Instead, to detect changes with SAR data, the following can be calculated:

-   Ratio Images (the original, just involves dividing images)

-   Improved Ratio

-   Mean ratio images

-   Log Ratio Images

-   Improved Log Ratio Images

To determine which is best we can look at an ROC curve.

If we want to look at identifying changes through image collections we can look at specific published methodologies, fuse imagery to optical data and classify it or use statistical tests such as a t-test.

## Applications

SAR data has many uses, the table below shows the most popular uses of SAR imagery.

Looking at one of the applications, mapping oil spills, I found a study that used C-band Sentinel- 1A data to detect oil spills in Chennai, on the East Coast of India [@dasariApplicationCbandSentinel1A2022]. The study used SAR data as it is less expensive than vessel-based and airborne-based detection methods and because of it's cloud penetrating ability that means it is weather independent. The oil spills were only visible in the VV channel, which was converted from linear to dB value to enhance the contrast oil spill in the image. As mentioned in the lectures, dB scale works best for identifying changes and differences in dark pixels such as water, which I think is demonstrated nicely in this study. A support vector machine and neural networks were used to classify the oil spill, which both had an overall accuracy of around 98% which is very high. Neural networks are understood to be 'black boxes' due to their hidden layers as they are hard to understand, so I would be interested to see how another classification method such as a random forest classifier would have performed.

I was interested to see why SAR data suited oil spill analysis and I found out that it is because the patches of oil show as dark spots in the water and the boundary between these patches and the surrounding water is quite visible in SAR images. This is because the oil film can reduce Bragg waves on the ocean surface [@chenMarineOilSpill2022].

## Reflections

I'm planning on using SAR data in my dissertation to map out floods and informal settlements, so I've been doing a lot of reading around different methodologies and every study I looked at would have a focus on choosing the right polarisation and scale for SAR data. When reading through these studies, I thought I sort of understood these concepts but after going over it this week I feel like I am finally confident I have a full understanding of it. Which I'm really glad of since I think it's one of the most important aspects to consider when looking at SAR data as your results will change based on the type of polarisation chosen.

I knew that in remote sensing you have to consider different factors (eg. seasonality) that might affect your analysis but I think the study on forest types and species really highlighted the extent of that and how for certain studies there might be more factors to consider.

I aim to take these considerations forward when working on my dissertation and hopefully later on down the line too!
