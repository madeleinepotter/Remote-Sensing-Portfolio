## Summary

This week we had a more in-depth look into Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

### Key Words:

**Backscatter:** the proportion of outgoing radar signal that the target surface redirects back to the sensor.

**Amplitude:** the amount of radar signal that returns to the sensor (backscatter).

**Phase:** the alignment of the wavelength when it returns to the sensor.

**Polarization:** the orientation of the plane in which electromagnetic waves are transmitted.

### SAR

The way SAR works is the sensor emits an electromagnetic (microwaves) signal towards the earth's surface and it collects data by recording the amount of signal that is bounced back and the time delay. SAR is an active sensor and it's main advantage is that it can 'see through' clouds, which optical sensors cannot do. It can do this because the wavelength is longer than cloud particles so the signal travelling through is largely unaffected by refraction.

SAR can collect data at different polarizations and as different surfaces respond differently to each polarization it is a useful way to draw out different land cover features.

-   Rough Scattering is most sensitive to vertical vertical (VV)

-   Volume Scattering is most sensitive to to cross polarized data such as vertical horizontal (VH) or horizontal vertical (HV)

-   Double Bounce is most sensitive to horizontal horizontal (HH)

### Identifying Change

Remotely sensed data can be used to detect changes in the earth's surface over time. We can do this with SAR data.

It is possible to subtract images to identify differences in pixel values, however this is not best practice for SAR data and is usually done with optical data.

Instead, to detect changes with SAR data, the following can be calculated:

-   Ratio Images (the original, just involves dividing images)

-   Improved Ratio

-   Mean ratio images

-   Log Ratio Images

-   Improved Log Ratio Images

To determine which is best we can look at an ROC curve.

If we want to look at identifying changes through image collections we can look at specific published methodologies, fuse imagery to optical data and classify it or use statistical tests such as a t-test.

## Applications

SAR data has many uses, the table below shows the most popular uses of SAR imagery.
