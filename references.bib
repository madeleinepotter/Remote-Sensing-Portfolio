  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that exposure to greenness benefits health, but studies assess greenness differently. We hypothesize greenness-health associations vary by exposure assessment method. To test this, we considered four vegetation datasets (three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index datasets with different spatial resolutions and a finely-resolved land cover dataset), and six aggregation units (five radial buffer sizes and self-described neighborhoods) of each dataset. We compared associations of self-rated health and these metrics of greenness among a sample of New York City residents. Associations with self-rated health varied more by aggregation unit than by vegetation dataset; larger buffers and self-described neighborhoods showed more positive associations. Researchers should consider spatial exposure misclassification in future greenness and health research.},

  abstract = {Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite-based remote sensing technique, has application for monitoring subsidence with high resolution over short periods. DInSAR uses radar images to measure centimeter-level surface displacements. In the images, ground resolution can be relatively high, with each data point (pixel) representing the average displacement over an area of several square meters. The image data are acquired regularly which allows subsidence to be monitored sequentially over short periods; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. Monitoring subsidence over short periods with high spatial resolution has potential to provide insight into the dynamics of subsidence and into relationships between mine advance and subsidence. In this study, for three longwall mines in the western United States, initial subsidence occurring at the start of longwall advance is quantified over short periods (12{\textendash}72~days). C-band interferometric wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. Overall, the data show initial development of subsidence, expansion of the subsidence trough, and the advance of subsidence in the direction of mining.},

  abstract = {Urbanization has accelerated the conversion of vegetated land to built-up regions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of urban park configuration on the Land Surface Temperature of the park and adjacent areas. In urban parks, the study analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The NDVI categorization process resulted in the development of a vegetation density distribution. The majority of Medan's urban areas were categorized as low density, as seen by their low NDVI values. The NDBI values were significantly higher in the majority of the area. This shows that the majority of places are experiencing a decline in vegetation cover. The density of vegetation varies according to the placement of park components such as trees, mixed plants, recreation, and sports areas. According to LST data, the temperature in the urban park was cooler than in the surrounding areas. Although the surrounding areas are densely populated, urban parks are dominated by trees. Additionally, there is a green space adjacent to the park, which is a green lane that runs alongside the main roadways.},
