  abstract = {The global sea-level rise (SLR) projections for the next few decades are the basis for developing flooding maps that depict the expected hazard scenarios. However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001--2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 {\textpm} 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 {\textpm} 0.05 m and 1.52 {\textpm} 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km2 that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years.},

We present a multi-source data approach aimed at investigating the complex and fragile environment of this area which is heavily affected by groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence.

The produced ground deformation maps and associated time-series allow us to detect a wide land subsidence extending for about 1200 km2 and measure vertical displacements reaching up to 10 cm in the observed time interval. DInSAR results, complemented with climatic, stratigraphic and piezometric data as well as with land-cover changes information, allow us to give more insights on the impact of climate changes and human activities on groundwater resources depletion and land subsidence.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of marine trade, marine oil pollution is becoming increasingly severe, which can exert damage to the health of the marine environment. Therefore, detection of marine oil spills is important for effectively starting the oil-spill cleaning process and the protection of the marine environment. The polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) technique has been applied to the detection of marine oil spills in recent years. However, most current studies still focus on using the simple intensity or amplitude information of SAR data and the detection results are not reliable enough. This paper presents a deep-learning-based method to detect oil spills on the marine surface from Sentinel-1 PolSAR satellite images. Specifically, attention gates are added to the U-Net network architecture, which ensures that the model focuses more on feature extraction. In the training process of the model, sufficient Sentinel-1 PolSAR images are selected as sample data. The polarimetric information from the PolSAR dataset and the wind-speed information of the marine surface are both taken into account when training the model and detecting oil spills. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional methods, and taking into account both the polarimetric and wind-speed information, can indeed improve the oil-spill detection results. In addition, the model shows pleasing performance in capturing the fine details of the boundaries of the oil-spill patches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for monitoring and detection of oil spills. In this work, a case study of an oil spill has been investigated using C-band Sentinel-1A SAR data to detect the oil spill that occurred on 28 January 2017, near Ennore port, Chennai, India. Oil spill damages marine ecosystems causing serious environmental effects. Quite often, oil spills on the sea/ocean surface are seen nowadays, mainly in major shipping routes. They are caused due to tanker collisions, illegal discharge from the ships, etc. An oil spill can be monitored and detected using various platforms such as vessel-based, airborne-based and satellite-based. Vessel based and airborne methods are expensive with less area coverage. This process also consumes more time. For ocean applications such as oil spill and Ship detection, optical sensors cannot image during bad weather. As SAR is an active sensor, weather independent, and has cloud penetrating capability, the images can be acquired during the day as well as at night. Radar Remote Sensing (RRS) has rapidly gained popularity for monitoring and detection of oil spills and ships for more than a decade. With the availability of the satellite images, detection of oil spill has improved due to its wide coverage and less revisit time. The present paper gives an overview of the methodologies used to detect oil spills on the SAR images using dual-pol Sentinel-1A Level 1 SLC data. This work clearly demonstrates the preprocessing steps of the Sentinel 1A data for oil spill detection. The oil spill was only visible in the VV channel, therefore, for ocean application VV channel image is preferred. SEASAT was the first space-borne SAR mission launched in 1978 by NASA to observe sea surface. The preprocessing was carried out at the European Space Agency (ESA), the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox and Envi 5.1 toolbox. Based on the Sigma naught values, oil spill can be discriminated with the ocean surface. The results obtained with the VV channel are satisfactory and one could map out the oil spill very well. Supervised classifiers SVM and NN were applied on the boxcar filtered 3~{\texttimes}~3 VV channel image to delineate the oil spill. The result of oil spill detection mapping is validated with Supervised SVM and Neural Network classifiers. The results show there is a good agreement between oil spill mapping and classified image using SVM and NN classified images. The Overall Accuracy (OA) obtained using SVM classifier is 98.13\% with kappa coefficient as 0.95 and using NN classifier is 98.11\% with kappa coefficients 0.95. This technique is considered to be a potential proxy for the detection and monitoring of Oil spills on water bodies. Application of SAR data for oil spill detection is considered to be first of its kind from Indian coasts. This study aims to detect the oil spill occurred due to collision of two LPG tankers with Sentinel-1A SLC data in Chennai coast area.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric datasets are widely used in the detection and classification of urban areas. Most methods used today are based on the decomposition of fully polarimetric SAR data, which allows for the extraction of physical information about the nature of the medium and the application of proper classification methods. According to the theory, the main and predominant backscattering mechanism for buildings is double bounce. However, when analyzing urban environments, the observed predominant backscatter may differ from theory depending on many aspects. In this paper, we analyze fully polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data for various cities located on different continents, proving that the theory does not hold for most cases. There are many factors that have an impact on the detected backscatter mechanism, and the theoretical principle of predominant double bounce in urban areas can be met only under specific conditions. These factors are, among others, the orientation of the buildings, the dimensions of the streets, the type of construction (i.e., numerous planes on the roof), etc. This paper also mentions the canonical example of San Francisco, widely analyzed in the literature, as a case showing the impact of building deorientation on double bounce scattering. This area of interest is also discussed in terms of the impact of SAR data resolution on the detection of specific backscatter mechanisms. The findings of this work are very useful for increasing the awareness of the utilization of classification approaches where only pixels with double bounce backscatter mechanisms are classified as urban areas. Moreover, the article lists factors that should be taken into consideration when performing urban area detection based only on polarimetric data and standard algorithms, such as street and building orientation, building heights, and structures.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, provide key ecosystem services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, combined anthropogenic activities and climatic change-driven sea level rise (SLR) pose a severe threat to their global persistence, and to the continued delivery of these services. Mangrove vulnerability to SLR depends upon capacity for both resilience (landward migration) and resistance (maintained functioning with the existing distribution), which are in turn hindered by extractive activities and coastal infrastructure development. Limited landscape-scale data availability means existing SLR vulnerability assessment frameworks lack rigorous quantification of these discrete processes. Here we develop and implement a novel multi-product (multispectral, microwave, derived-product) open-access satellite remote sensing approach to assess both coastal ecosystem SLR resilience and resistance capacity in multiple mangrove sites across the world, and landscape-level and anthropogenic factors driving these capacities. Our approach allows comparative ranking of resilience and resistance capacities across sites, based on relative observed ecosystem change (biomass, distribution) and in constraints to these two components of SLR vulnerability. We observe mostly low SLR resilience and resistance across our case study sites. Furthermore, we find that site-specific resilience and resistance capacities and constraints can be highly incongruent, highlighting the importance of comprehensive SLR vulnerability monitoring for effective management. High within-site variation was also detected in resilience and resistance capacities and their constraints. This underlines the importance of spatially explicit monitoring at extensive spatial scales to inform decision making. The methodology developed and repeat-pass imagery employed adds to the remote monitoring and assessment toolkit for adaptive coastal ecosystem management under SLR, providing a new approach to inform conservation and management priority assessments in data-deficient regions.},

  abstract = {Conventional change detection approaches are mainly based on per-pixel processing, which ignore the sub-pixel spectral variation resulted from spectral mixture. Especially for medium-resolution remote sensing images used in urban land-cover change monitoring, land use/cover components within a single pixel are usually complicated and heterogeneous due to the limitation of the spatial resolution. Thus, traditional hard detection methods based on pure pixel assumption may lead to a high level of omission and commission errors inevitably, degrading the overall accuracy of change detection. In order to address this issue and find a possible way to exploit the spectral variation in a sub-pixel level, a novel change detection scheme is designed based on the spectral mixture analysis and decision-level fusion. Nonlinear spectral mixture model is selected for spectral unmixing, and change detection is implemented in a sub-pixel level by investigating the inner-pixel subtle changes and combining multiple composition evidences. The proposed method is tested on multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper and China--Brazil Earth Resources Satellite remote sensing images for the land-cover change detection over urban areas. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed in terms of several accuracy indices in contrast with two pixel-based change detection methods (i.e. change vector analysis and principal component analysis-based method). In particular, the proposed sub-pixel change detection approach not only provides the binary change information, but also obtains the characterization about change direction and intensity, which greatly extends the semantic meaning of the detected change targets.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of accuracy in land cover (LC) maps, several methods have been adopted to predict per-pixel land cover accuracy (PLCA) of classified remote sensing images. Such a PLCA map provides spatially-explicit accuracy information and is of paramount importance for both producers and end-users of LC maps to thoroughly understand the spatial distribution of accuracy. In this study, we proposed a simple yet powerful random forest (RF) based approach for PLCA mapping with limited reference sample data. The main assumption of the proposed approach is that the LC's misclassifications do not occur randomly, but rather exhibit some detectable characteristics which can be retrieved via the built model. With this approach, RF attempts to establish a nonlinear relationship between the accuracy and the same spectral bands used in LC classification. To confirm the proposed method as a consistent and practical approach for a variety of different settings, we evaluated it on five different classified remote sensing images derived from Landsat-8, Ikonos, and three Sentinel-2 images across different parts of Iran. In this manner, to validate the predictive capability of the RF-based method, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and several other statistical metrics, including sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). Analysis of the average values of these metrics (AUROC~=~0.88, SN~=~95\%, SP~=~68\%, PPV~=~96\%, NPV~=~72\%, and ACC~=~95\%) derived from the limited sample size datasets showed that the proposed model performs well in all case studies. The performance of the proposed model was further assessed through comparison against two benchmark methods, namely Gaussian kernel interpolation (GKI) and linear kernel interpolation (LKI). In conclusion, although our comprehensive evaluations revealed that RF, GKI, and LKI methods are promising approaches for PLCA mapping, RF outperformed both GKI and LKI in all of the experimental sites.},

  abstract = {Mapping informal settlements is crucial for resource and utility management and planning. In 2003, the UN-Habitat developed a process for mapping and monitoring urban inequality to support reporting against the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Informal settlement indicators are used as a framework to carry out image analysis, and include vegetation extent, lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land, road segment type and materials, texture measures of built-up areas, roofing extent of built-up areas and dwelling size. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods are recommended to identify informal settlements. This paper documents the application of OBIA to map informal settlements, drawing on the ontology of Kohli et al. (2012) and the indicators of Owen and Wong (2013) for a Middle Eastern city. Three informal settlements with different land use histories were selected to represent old and new informal settlements in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Vegetation extent was the most successful indicator detected, with 100\% producer accuracy and over 84\% user accuracy, followed by the road network, with 84\% producer and user accuracies in older informal settlements and 73\% producer accuracy and 96\% user accuracy across all case studies. Lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land was detected well in informal settlements. The texture measure indicator was detected using GLCMEnt(R) with low producer accuracy across all case studies. The roofing extent of the built-up area is detected with better producer and user accuracies than texture measures. The dwellings size indicator generally failed to distinguish formal from informal settlements. Informal and formal were distinguished with an overall accuracy of 83\%. This research concludes that OBIA is a useful method to map informal settlement indicators in Middle Eastern cities. However, a generic ruleset for mapping informal settlements remains elusive, and each indicator requires significant localised `tuning'.},

  abstract = {Elevation data are critical for assessments of sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal flooding exposure. Previous research has demonstrated that the quality of data used in elevation-based assessments must be well understood and applied to properly model potential impacts. The cumulative vertical uncertainty of the input elevation data substantially controls the minimum increments of SLR and the minimum planning horizons that can be effectively used in assessments. For regional, continental, or global assessments, several digital elevation models (DEMs) are available for the required topographic information to project potential impacts of increased coastal water levels, whether a simple inundation model is used or a more complex process-based or probabilistic model is employed. When properly characterized, the vertical accuracy of the DEM can be used to report assessment results with the uncertainty stated in terms of a specific confidence level or likelihood category. An accuracy evaluation has been conducted of global DEMs to quantify their inherent vertical uncertainty to demonstrate how accuracy information should be considered when planning and implementing a SLR or coastal flooding assessment. The evaluation approach includes comparison of the DEMs with high-accuracy geodetic control points as the independent reference data over a variety of coastal relief settings. The global DEMs evaluated include SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, TanDEM-X, NASADEM, and MERIT. High-resolution, high-accuracy DEM sources, such as airborne lidar and stereo imagery, are also included to give context to the results from the global DEMs. The accuracy characterization results show that current global DEMs are not adequate for high confidence mapping of exposure to fine increments ({$<$}1 m) of SLR or with shorter planning horizons ({$<$}100 years) and thus they should not be used for such mapping, but they are suitable for general delineation of low elevation coastal zones. In addition to the best practice of rigorous accounting for vertical uncertainty, other recommended procedures are presented for delineation of different types of impact areas (marine and groundwater inundation) and use of regional relative SLR scenarios. The requirement remains for a freely available, high-accuracy, high-resolution global elevation model that supports quantitative SLR and coastal inundation assessments at high confidence levels.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation is a critical and important step in (GEographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA). The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects.

  abstract = {Many cities in the global South are facing the emergence and growth of highly dynamic slum areas, but often lack detailed information on these developments. Available statistical data are commonly aggregated to large, heterogeneous administrative units that are geographically meaningless for informing effective pro-poor policies. General base information neither allows spatially disaggregated analysis of deprived areas nor monitoring of rapidly changing settlement dynamics, which characterize slums. This paper explores the utility of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance to distinguish between slums and formal built-up (formal) areas in very high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery such as WorldView-2, OrbView, Quickbird, and Resourcesat. Three geographically different cities are selected for this investigation: Mumbai and Ahmedabad, India and Kigali, Rwanda. The exploration of the utility and transferability of the GLCM shows that the variance of the GLCM combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is able to separate slums and formal areas. The overall accuracy achieved is 84\% in Kigali, 87\% in Mumbai, and 88\% in Ahmedabad. Furthermore, combining spectral information with the GLCM variance within a random forest classifier results in a pixel-based classification accuracy of 90\%. The final slum map, aggregated to homogenous urban patches (HUPs), shows an accuracy of 88\%-95\% for slum locations depending on the scale parameter.},

Classifications representing the LCCS Level 3 taxonomy (8 categories representing semi-(natural) and/or cultivated/managed vegetation or natural or artificial bare or water bodies) were generated for two time periods and across four test sites located in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. This was achieved by progressively and hierarchically combining existing time-static layers relating to (a) the extent of artificial surfaces (urban, water) and agriculture and (b) annual summaries of EVs relating to the extent of vegetation (fractional cover) and water (hydroperiod, intertidal area, mangroves) generated through DEA. More detailed classifications that integrated information on, for example, forest structure (based on vegetation cover (\%) and height (m); time-static for 2009) and hydroperiod (months), were subsequently produced for each time-step. The overall accuracies of the land cover classifications were dependent upon those reported for the individual input layers, with these ranging from 80\% (for cultivated, urban and artificial water) to over 95\% (for hydroperiod and fractional cover). The changes identified include mangrove dieback in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria and reduced dam water levels and an associated expansion of vegetation in Lake Ross, Burdekin. The extent of detected changes corresponded with those observed using time-series of RapidEye data (2014 to 2016; for the Gulf of Carpentaria) and Google Earth imagery (2009--2016 for Lake Ross). This use case demonstrates the capacity and a conceptual framework to implement EODESM within DEA and provides countries using the Open Data Cube (ODC) environment with the opportunity to routinely generate land cover maps from Landsat or Sentinel-1/2 data, at least annually, using a consistent and internationally recognised taxonomy.},

The achievement of development goals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, requires access to up-to-date information on informal settlements. This review provides an overview of studies that used object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques to detect informal settlements using remotely sensed data. This paper focuses on three main aspects: image processing steps followed when detecting informal settlements using OBIA; informal settlement indicators and image-based proxies used to detect informal settlements; and a review of studies that extracted and analyzed informal settlement land use objects. The success of OBIA in detecting informal settlements depends on the understanding and selection of informal settlement indicators and image-based proxies used during image classification. To meet the local ontology of informal settlements, the transfer of OBIA mapping techniques requires the fine-tuning of the rulesets. Machine learning OBIA techniques using image proxies derived from multiple sensors increase the opportunities for detecting informal settlements on the city or national level.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the `cloud'. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25\%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31\%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22\%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. `Remote Sensing' and `Remote Sensing of Environment' were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.},

We found that: (1) SVM and NB were superior to CART and KNN, and both could achieve high classification accuracy ({$>$}90\%); (2) the setting of tuning parameters greatly affected classification accuracy, particularly for the most commonly-used SVM classifier; the optimal values of tuning parameters might vary slightly with the size of training samples;  (3) the size of training sample also greatly affected the classification accuracy, when the size of training sample was less than 125. Increasing the size of training samples generally led to the increase of classification accuracies for all four classifiers. In addition, NB and KNN were more sensitive to the sample sizes. This research provides insights into the selection of classifiers and the size of training samples. It also highlights the importance of the appropriate setting of tuning parameters for different machine learning classifiers and provides useful information for optimizing these parameters.},

Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is one such crop that is a major driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia. We evaluated the use of a semi-automated approach with random forest as a classifier and combined optical and radar datasets to classify oil palm land-cover in 2015 in Sumatra, Indonesia, using Google Earth Engine. We compared our map with two existing remotely-sensed oil palm land-cover products that utilized visual and semi-automated approaches for the same year. We evaluated the accuracy of oil palm land-cover classification from optical (Landsat), radar (synthetic aperture radar (SAR)), and combined optical and radar satellite imagery (Combined). Combining Landsat and SAR data resulted in the highest overall classification accuracy (84\%) and highest producer's and user's accuracy for oil palm classification (84\% and 90\%, respectively). The amount of oil palm land-cover in our Combined map was closer to official government statistics than the two existing land-cover products that used visual interpretation techniques. Our analysis of the extents of disagreement in oil palm land-cover indicated that our map had comparable accuracy to one of them and higher accuracy than the other. Our results demonstrate that a combination of optical and radar data outperforms the use of optical-only or radar-only datasets for oil palm classification and that our technique of preprocessing and classifying combined optical and radar data in the Google Earth Engine can be applied to accurately monitor oil-palm land-cover in Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) was applied for land-cover characterization using MODIS time-series data. Classification performance was examined with respect to training sample size, sample variability, and landscape homogeneity (purity). The results were compared to two conventional nonparametric image classification algorithms: multilayer perceptron neural networks (NN) and classification and regression trees (CART). For 2001 MODIS time-series data, SVM generated overall accuracies ranging from 77\% to 80\% for training sample sizes from 20 to 800 pixels per class, compared to 67--76\% and 62--73\% for NN and CART, respectively. These results indicated that SVM's had superior generalization capability, particularly with respect to small training sample sizes. There was also less variability of SVM performance when classification trials were repeated using different training sets. Additionally, classification accuracies were directly related to sample homogeneity/heterogeneity. The overall accuracies for the SVM algorithm were 91\% (Kappa=0.77) and 64\% (Kappa=0.34) for homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels, respectively. The inclusion of heterogeneous pixels in the training sample did not increase overall accuracies. Also, the SVM performance was examined for the classification of multiple year MODIS time-series data at annual intervals. Finally, using only the SVM output values, a method was developed to directly classify pixel purity. Approximately 65\% of pixels within the Albemarle--Pamlico Basin study area were labeled as ``functionally homogeneous'' with an overall classification accuracy of 91\% (Kappa=0.79). The results indicated a high potential for regional scale operational land-cover characterization applications.},

However, previous studies have shown that the SRTM DEM is systematically higher than the actual land surface in vegetated mountain areas. The objective of this study is to propose a procedure to calibrate the SRTM DEM over large vegetated mountain areas. Firstly, we developed methods to estimate canopy cover from aerial imagery and tree height from multi-source datasets (i.e., field observations, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data, Landsat TM imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data). Then, the airborne LiDAR derived DEM, covering {\textasciitilde}5\% of the study area, was used to evaluate the accuracy of the SRTM DEM. Finally, a regression model of the SRTM DEM error depending on tree height, canopy cover, and terrain slope was developed to calibrate the SRTM DEM. Our results show that the proposed procedure can significantly improve the accuracy of the SRTM DEM over vegetated mountain areas. The mean difference between the SRTM DEM and the LiDAR DEM decreased from 12.15 m to -0.82 m, and the standard deviation dropped by 2 m.},

Hydrodynamic, geomorphological, climatic, and socio-economic parameters and three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for 2050 and 2070 with two global climate model datasets (the Centre National de Recherches M{\'e}t{\'e}orologiques Climate model version 5 [CNRM-CM5.1] and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate [MIROC5]) were used to predict suitable areas for mangrove planting. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the level of importance for each parameter. To test the accuracy of the results, the mangrove land suitability analysis were further compared using different weights in every parameter. The sensitivity test using the Wilcoxon test was also carried out to test which variables had changed with the first weight and the AHP weight. The land suitability products from this study were compared with those from previous studies. The differences in land suitability for each country in Southeast Asia in 2050 and 2070 to analyze the differences in each RCP scenario and their effects on the mangrove land suitability were also assessed. Currently, there is 398,000 ha of potentially suitable land for mangrove planting in Southeast Asia, and this study shows that it will increase between now and 2070. Indonesia account for 67.34\% of the total land area in the ``very suitable'' and ``suitable'' class categories. The RCP 8.5 scenario in 2070, with both the MIROC5 and CNRM-CM5.1 models, resulted in the largest area of a ``very suitable'' class category for mangrove planting. This study provides information for the migration of mangrove forests to the land, alleviating many drawbacks, especially for ecosystems.},

The great range of SAR imagery applications is summarized in this paper. We organize the most popular methods and their applications in a cohesive manner. SAR data applications are classified into earth observation and object detection applications and the former are separated into land, sea, and ice applications. We present the basic methodologies and recent advances in land cover classification and object detection, as well as techniques for parameter retrieval from SAR data. We give advantages and disadvantages and highlight the particular characteristics of each method. It is shown that usage of SAR contributes to the amelioration of techniques and to the enhancement of reliability.},

  abstract = {The multitemporal acquisition of images from the Sentinel-1 satellites allows continuous monitoring of a forest. This study focuses on the use of multitemporal C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to assess the results for forest type (FTY), between coniferous and deciduous forest, and tree species (SPP) classification. We also investigated the temporal stability through the use of backscatter from multiple seasons and years of acquisition. SAR acquisitions were pre-processed, histogram-matched, smoothed, and temperature-corrected. The normalized average backscatter was extracted for interpreted plots and used to train Random Forest models. The classification results were then validated with field plots. A principal component analysis was tested to reduce the dimensionality of the explanatory variables, which generally improved the results. Overall, the FTY classifications were promising, with higher accuracies (OA of 0.94 and K = 0.86) than the SPP classification (OA of 0.66 and K = 0.54). The use of merely winter images (OA = 0.89) reached, on average, results that were almost as good as those using of images from the entire year. The use of images from a single winter season reached a similar result (OA = 0.87). We conclude that multiple Sentinel-1 images acquired in winter conditions are feasible to classify forest types in a hemi-boreal Swedish forest.},

  abstract = {In Indonesia, tsunamis are frequent events. In 2000--2016, there were 44 tsunami events in Indonesia, with financial losses reaching 43.38 trillion. In 2018, a tsunami occurred in the Sunda Strait due to the eruption of the Anak Krakatau Volcano, which caused many fatalities and much building damage. This study aimed to detect the building damage in the Labuan District, Banten Province. Machine learning methods were used to detect building damage using random forest with object-based techniques. No previous research has combined selected predictors into scenarios; hence, the novelty of this study is combining various random forest predictors to identify the extent of building damage using 14 predictor scenarios. In addition, field surveys were conducted two years and nine months after the tsunami to observe the changes and efforts made. The results of the random forest classification were validated and compared with three datasets, namely xBD, Copernicus, and field survey data. The results of this study can help classify the level of building damage using satellite imagery to improve mitigation in tsunami-prone areas.},

  abstract = {Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite-based remote sensing technique, has application for monitoring subsidence with high resolution over short periods. DInSAR uses radar images to measure centimeter-level surface displacements. In the images, ground resolution can be relatively high, with each data point (pixel) representing the average displacement over an area of several square meters. The image data are acquired regularly which allows subsidence to be monitored sequentially over short periods; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. Monitoring subsidence over short periods with high spatial resolution has potential to provide insight into the dynamics of subsidence and into relationships between mine advance and subsidence. In this study, for three longwall mines in the western United States, initial subsidence occurring at the start of longwall advance is quantified over short periods (12--72~days). C-band interferometric wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. Overall, the data show initial development of subsidence, expansion of the subsidence trough, and the advance of subsidence in the direction of mining.},

  abstract = {Urbanization has accelerated the conversion of vegetated land to built-up regions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of urban park configuration on the Land Surface Temperature of the park and adjacent areas. In urban parks, the study analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The NDVI categorization process resulted in the development of a vegetation density distribution. The majority of Medan's urban areas were categorized as low density, as seen by their low NDVI values. The NDBI values were significantly higher in the majority of the area. This shows that the majority of places are experiencing a decline in vegetation cover. The density of vegetation varies according to the placement of park components such as trees, mixed plants, recreation, and sports areas. According to LST data, the temperature in the urban park was cooler than in the surrounding areas. Although the surrounding areas are densely populated, urban parks are dominated by trees. Additionally, there is a green space adjacent to the park, which is a green lane that runs alongside the main roadways.},

  abstract = {Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a ''geobrowser'', and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., ``land cover'', ``water'', ``model'', ``vegetation'', and ``forest''), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.},
