  abstract = {Mu Us Sandy Land is a typical semi-arid vulnerable ecological zone, characterized by vegetation degradation and severe desertification. Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China. However, most previous studies have used a single method or remote sensing index to monitor desertification, and lacked an efficient and high-precision monitoring system. In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial–temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67\%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74\%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators. (c) Since 2000, the area of extremely severe desertified land has shown a reversal trend; however, there is significant interannual fluctuation in the total and light desertification land area affected by extreme climate. This research provides a novel approach and a valuable reference for monitoring the evolution of desertification in regional studies, and the results improve the research system of desertification and provide a data basis for desertification cause analysis and prevention.},

Results show an SST increase of 0.040~±~0.001 °C/yr. The seasonal maximum trend is associated to summer 0.070~±~0.001 °C/yr, followed by winter, (0.040~±~0.001) °C/yr, autumn 0.030~±~0.001 °C/yr and spring, 0.020~±~0.001 °C/yr. The total period analyzed has been divided into ten-year time spans, showing a stable increase of 0.055 °C/yr in average, from period 2005–2014 onwards. In absolute SST values terms, the parameter range is of 0.85°C from year 2005 to 2019. We have also analyzed the spatial variability of the parameter by dividing the Mediterranean Sea into nine sub-basins: Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea (Iberian Sea), Mediterranean Western Basin, Mediterranean Eastern Basin, Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea. The results show warming trends from 0.02 °C/yr for the Alboran Sea to 0.07°C/yr for the Adriatic Sea. Results have been validated by using data from a local observational buoy system, obtaining a coefficient of determination of 0.97.},

As expected, cities spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation or farmland is cheaper. Respectively 100\% and 87\% of the cities exhibit the expected negative density and rent gradients: on average, a 1\% decrease in income net of transportation costs leads to a 21\% decrease in densities and a 3\% decrease in rents per m2. We also investigate the heterogeneity between cities of different characteristics in terms of monocentricity, informality, and amenities.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of the UHI effect, diurnal and nocturnal, in the dry season in 21 Brazilian metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2016. Surface temperature, mean albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values generated by the MODIS sensor (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used. The results obtained showed substantial differences between diurnal and nocturnal UHI effects. Manaus, Porto Alegre, Belém, and Recife presented the highest values of diurnal UHI, whereas Curitiba, Brasília, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro showed higher heat island effects at night. The results are an alert to policymakers of the need to rethink land occupation regulations and also give support to actions to mitigate the phenomenon.},

In this article, we explore the capability of short-term property rental data to identify neighbourhoods where change is occurring. The article focuses on the relationship between data from the Airbnb platform and gentrification. Through a study in Dublin, Ireland, Airbnb data was analysed using state-of-the-art Emerging Hotspot Analysis to identify locations with high potential to experience gentrification and areas that have undergone recent development. The locations identified by the method are correlated with gentrification and neighbourhood change described in other literature. The spatiotemporal approach reveals more about locational changes in the city than other methods, which focus only on one component, such as space or time. The study highlights the importance of access to real estate market data, such as data about the short-term rental market, to extract spatiotemporal changes occurring in neighbourhoods. The results contribute to the discourse on the impacts of short-term rental and Airbnb on cities and can be used by policymakers, observers, and citizens to motivate the distribution of services. The question as to whether gentrification or Airbnb came first remains an open one.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that exposure to greenness benefits health, but studies assess greenness differently. We hypothesize greenness-health associations vary by exposure assessment method. To test this, we considered four vegetation datasets (three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index datasets with different spatial resolutions and a finely-resolved land cover dataset), and six aggregation units (five radial buffer sizes and self-described neighborhoods) of each dataset. We compared associations of self-rated health and these metrics of greenness among a sample of New York City residents. Associations with self-rated health varied more by aggregation unit than by vegetation dataset; larger buffers and self-described neighborhoods showed more positive associations. Researchers should consider spatial exposure misclassification in future greenness and health research.},

  abstract = {This paper studies how the presence of universities and hospitals influences local home prices and rents. We analyze the data on ZIP code level and on the level of individual homes. Our ZIP code-level analysis uses median home price data from 13,105 ZIP codes over 21~years and rent data from 15,918 ZIP codes over 7~years to compare a ZIP code’s appreciation, volatility and vacancies to the size of a university or hospital within that ZIP code. Our home-level analysis uses data from 2,786,895 homes for sale and 267,486 homes for rent to study the impact of the distance from the nearest university or hospital to individual home prices. While our results generally agree with our expectations that larger, closer institutions yield higher prices, we also find some interesting results that challenge these expectations, such as positive correlations between volatility and university/hospital size in some ZIP codes, a positive correlation between rent and distance from a hospital for some homes, and lower correlations of rent vs. distance from a university compared to price vs. distance.}
