## **Summary:**

### **Key words and phrases from this week:**

**Digital Number (DN**): a raw value assigned to a pixel which has not yet been calibrated to describe the intensity of electromagnetic radiation of the pixel. To be meaningful, needs to be adjusted by gain and offset.

**Radiance**: The brightness or light that the sensor 'observes'. Usually measured in watt/(steradian/square metre) and might be called Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.

**Reflectance**: The ratio of light reflected by a surface to the total amount of light hitting the surface. It has no units. Can come as surface reflectance, Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) and Top of Atmosphere.

**Solar Zenith:** The zenith angle of the sun which is the angle between the sun and the vertical. ( 90 degrees -- angle of elevation of sun)

### **Corrections**

Remotely sensed data can contain errors created by the atmosphere, the sensor itself and the surface it is observing. There are four types of corrections that aim to correct for such errors. These are atmospheric correction, geometric correction, orthorectification and radiometric calibration.

Orthorectification is a subset of georectification. It removes distortions caused by the topography of the Earth's surface and the tilt of the sensor by stretching the image. Radiometric calibration is the process of converting the raw satellite data (digital numbers) into physical units.

Here I will go into more detail on atmospheric and geometric correction as I found them to be the most interesting.

#### **Atmospheric Correction:**

Atmospheric correction is the process of removing the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption on reflectance values. It is required when using biophysical parameters and using spectral signatures through time and space. There are two types of atmospheric correction, relative and absolute correction. Relative correction can compare and normalise the different bands within a single image or across several images of the same scene. Absolute correction converts digital brightness of the pixels to units of radiance or reflectance to compare against the scaled surface values over the earth.

#### **Geometric Correction:**

Geometric correction is the process of correcting for positional errors caused by factors such as satellite or aircraft instability, the earth's rotation and curvature and instrument error.Â  Ground control points (GCP) and a reference dataset are needed to model the coordinates to give them transformation coefficients. GCPs are usually points that highly contrast against the surround area often being roads, corners of buildings, distinctive water bodies or the edges of land cover areas.

We also covered enhancement which I will explore in the applications section.

## **Applications**

As corrections made to remotely sensed data can significantly improve the quality by removing errors and distortions, I can imagine it is used in all areas of remote sensing, whether you are manually correcting the data yourself or using data that has already been corrected.

Therefore, for the application section I would like to focus on the applications of remote sensing enhancements.

### **Ratio Enhancements: NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index)**

Studies that use NDVI cover a wide range of topics that appear to span over several disciplines.

I decided look at NDVI in an urban context to see how it has been used to investigate phenomena in cities. Most studies exploring this appear to investigate the impact of vegetation and greenery on the surrounding environment and even on inhabitants of cities.

Several studies have used NDVI to explore the impact of urban greening on land surface temperatures. @zaitunahUrbanGreeningEffect2022 produced NDVI maps of the city of Medan, Indonesia and demonstrated that temperatures in urban parks which had lots of trees were significantly lower than the surrounding areas. By taking NDVI values, different parks could be compared to each other and classified into different vegetation density classes, which allowed for the specific finding on the importance of trees. For a study such as this one where the density of trees is likely not going to be especially high, I think the use of NDVI is effective. However, when looking at areas with dense canopies, another vegetation index such as the enhanced vegetation index (an adjusted version of NDVI) might be more useful as it can be more accurate in these areas.

While NDVI has proven to be a useful tool when analysing and quantifying vegetation density, [@reidItNotEasy2018] points out the difficulty of using NDVI to measure 'greenness' consistently across studies exploring health outcomes. Difficulties mainly arise in the different ways 'greenness' is measured, issues caused by the modifiable unit areal problem and differences in atmospheric correction, view angle and calibration of the NDVI datasets used across studies. While some of these issues don't directly relate to the NDVI itself, it is certainly something to consider when using it.

## **Reflection**

I can't lie this was a lot of information to get my head around and I'm quite relieved that when we come to using Google Earth Engine the data will come already corrected. I can however understand why this was covered and just how necessary corrections are (even if they look intimidating) to ensure data quality and allowing for different images to be compared. I also see the importance of understanding the ways remotely sensed images can be manipulated which means that we can look further than just what is on the surface of that data. This relates back to the point made on the difficulty of exploring NDVI consistently across different studies and how atmospheric correction has an impact on this.

As most data comes already corrected, I'm guessing my use of remote sensing corrections will be limited however I can see how I could use enhancements in the future to explore different features of the landscape. For example, PCA would be really useful in remote sensing (which as we know, deals with large amounts of data) for creating smaller datasets by getting rid of redundant spectral information while also maintaining as much original information as possible.
